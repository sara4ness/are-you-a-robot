+ what is [a] (period|periods)
- A period is part of the natural menstrual cycle. It's when the lining of your uterus sheds, leading to blood and tissue coming out of your vagina. A period will usually last anywhere from 2-7 days but will vary for everyone!\n 
^If your period changes drastically surrounding duration, or flow you may want to consult your doctor for a check-up and advice! 

+ (do i|have i|have|get|got) * period
- If you notice blood or blood clumping coming from your vagina, then you probably have your period! Do not worry ü´∂üèª \n 
^A period is part of the natural menstrual cycle. It's when the lining of your uterus sheds, leading to blood and tissue coming out of your vagina. A period will usually last anywhere from 2-7 days but will vary for everyone!\n 
^If your period changes drastically surrounding duration, or flow you may want to consult your doctor for a check-up and advice! 

+ what happens on a period  
- Each month your body prepares for pregnancy by releasing an egg from your ovaries, if this egg is not fertilised by sperm, the uterus starts a process to get rid of it. This process is what we call a period. The uterus starts shedding the inner lining leading to blood and tissue exiting from your vagina. 

+ what is period poverty
- Period poverty is the lack of access to sanitary products due to financial constraints. It negatively affects girls and women across the world, as it prevents them from accessing basic period essentials required each month throughout their menstruation cycle.\n 
^Although period poverty is still a devastating issue, there are now organisations trying to combat this limited access to necessities.\n 
^If you are currently struggling with period poverty, I am happy to provide additional information about where you can access support, just ask "How can I access free sanitary products?" 

+ how can i access (free sanitary products|sanitary products)
- If you are in need of period poverty support or access to free sanitary products, here are a few options available for you:\n  
^ - You can request free period products here: <a href="https://www.freedom4girls.co.uk/request-products/ ">www.freedom4girls.co.uk</a>\n
^ - You can also contact your local council to see where they are currently providing free products here: <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/free-period-products ">Rwww.mygov.scot/free-period-products</a>\n
^ - If you are currently a student in a state maintained school, or a 16 to 19 education organisation in England, your place of study is required to provide free sanitary products upon request under the government period product scheme. Just ask a member of staff!\n
^ - You can also download the Pickupmyperiod app in App Store to find period products available in the area! 

+ why (did|have) i (miss|missed) (a period|my period)
- Periods are a natural part of our body's menstrual cycle, and although on average a cycle last 28 days, it may vary from person to person or month to month, so your period may be slightly later or earlier each time. This is usually nothing to be worried about. There are many reasons why you may have missed a period. Some of the most common factors are:\n 
^ - If you are taking medication or birth control 
^ - If you have had a lot of stress recently  
^ - If you are pregnant  
^ - If you have lost a lot of weight 
^ - If you are not eating enough  
^ - Hormonal changes 
^ - Underlying health conditions\n 
^If you are sexually active, it is advised that you take a pregnancy test when you notice you have missed your period. However, there is no way of knowing the cause of missed periods without seeking professional medical help. So, we advise booking an appointment with your GP to discuss any concerns you have about a missed period.

+ do periods hurt
- Periods can hurt. It is very common to experience cramps in your stomach and back, as well as potentially in your thighs or around your bum. The intensity of these pains may vary from person to person and period to period.\n 
^To relieve these pains you may want to try lying down, using a hot water bottle, taking painkillers, and drinking soothing teas like Raspberry leaf. You may also experience symptoms in the days leading up to a period for example tenderness and sensitivity in your breasts, headaches, fatigue, sensitivity in mood and cramping.\n 
^However, if you are experiencing extreme and uncomfortable pains do you do not regularly experience or that seem overly intense, you should contact your doctor to rule out conditions like endometriosis and PCOS. 

+ can i swim on my period
- Yes, you can swim on your period! However, you should use a tampon or menstrual cup unless your flow is very light.

+ how often should i change my tampon
- You should change your tampon every 4-8 hours, or when you feel it can no longer absorb more blood, whichever comes first. If you are not sure if it is time to change your tampon within this time bracket, you can simply check when in the toilet by gently tugging on the removal string. If it feels stiff and uncomfortable to remove you could probably leave it in for longer however do not exceed the 8 hours.

^What is a menstrual cup?\n
^How do I use a menstrual cup?\n
^How often should I clean my menstrual cup?\n
^How do I clean my menstrual cup?\n
^How often should I empty my menstrual cup?\n
^Can I swim with a menstrual cup?

+ what is a menstrual cup
- A menstrual cup is a menstrual hygiene device disc that is inserted into the vagina and sits below the cervix to collect menstrual fluid! Menstrual cups are usually made from silicone or latex and is therefore reusable. 

+ how do i use a menstrual cup
- A menstrual cup is a menstrual hygiene device disc that is inserted into the vagina and sits below the cervix to collect menstrual fluid! Menstrual cups are also reusable, making them more sustainable period product alternatives!  

+ how often should i clean my menstrual cup
- You should clean your menstrual cup after every use, or at least every 12 hours while on your period (whenever you empty and reuse it!) you should also sterilise the cup after every period.  

+ how do i clean my menstrual cup
- To clean your menstrual cup at home you should empty the period blood or fluid collection into the toilet, then, rinse it out with clean water, and use a mild, oil-free, fragrance-free soap to give it a quick clean. Once it's clean, you can reinsert the cup. At the end of every period, you should also sterilise the menstrual cup, to do this, after cleaning it with hot water ad a gentle soap, oyou can place it in boiling water to fully sanitize it before your next period.To quickly sanitise you can alsoo place your cup inside of a metal whisk and leave it in a pot of boiling water for only one to two minutes.  

+ how [often should i|long before i should] empty my menstrual cup
- Most menstrual cups can stay in for up to 12 hours before being emptied and rinsed. This means you can wear one when you're sleeping, or all day long. However, when your flow is at its heaviest, you may need to empty a cup more often. You can use the same cup for your heaviest and lightest days. 

+ can i swim with a menstrual cup
- Yes! Just like. tampon, menstrual cups are worn internally, and so can be worn while swimming! Just remember to clean your menstrual cup after swimming to prevent any bacteria collection.

^What are the side effects of birth control?\n
^What types of birth control exists?\n

+ [should i] [*] [birth control to] (regulate|help) [with] [my] (period|periods)
- Birth control is a safe, approved way to help regulate and maintain your period, but it isn't the only option!\n 
^There are many natural ways to help regulate menstrual health, for example adapting your diet to optimise the benefits of your food throughout your cycle.\n 
^You should always discuss any concerns you may be having surrounding your period with your GP or a trusted health care professional.\n  
^For more information about using the pill to regulate your period <a href="https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/health/period/using-the-pill-to-regulate-periods ">click here</a>

+ what [birth control] (is right for me|should i use)
- There are many different types of birth control available in the UK, which one is right for you is unique to your body and your needs! You may also need to try a few different birth controls until you find what's right for you, to do this speak with a healthcare professional such as your GP.\n 
^A few of the more popular options available to you are:\n 
^ - The contraceptive pill
^ - The implant
^ - The injection
^ - The IUD\n
^However, not every available option is suited to each individual, due to different hormonal requirements. A history of blood clots in the family may also limit the types of birth control available for you.\n
^For more information about which birth control is right for you consider reading the following article provided by the NHS:\n
^<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/which-method-suits-me/?tabname=methods-of-contraception">Read more here.</a>\n
^Please note, the best way to figure out what contraceptive method would work best for you is by discussing it with a healthcare professional, I recommend contacting your doctor or if you do not want to contact your family GP directly find your nearest sexual health clinic for advice!  

+ (what are the side effects of birth control|what birth control has the least side effects|* side effects * birth control)
- Each birth control method comes with it's own risks and side effects both short term and long term. Because of this, I recommend talking to your GP, nurse or pharmacist about the effects of your chosen birth control method.\n 
^However, some of the most common side effects to look out for are premenstrual symptoms such as tender breasts, headaches and nausea although these will differ for everyone.

+ does all birth control have hormones
-Although the more common birth control methods such as the combined pill, the injection and hormone releasing coils do contain hormones, there are many hormone free options! For example:
^ - The diaphragm  
^ - The copper IUD  
^ - The Sponge  
^ - Cervical Cap\n
^If you are interested in what none hormonal birth control method best suits you, contact a GP, or another qualified health professional, such as a sexual health clinic.

^If you are interested in what none hormonal birth control method best suits you, contact a GP, or another qualified health professional, such as a sexual health clinic.

+ what is (the pill|the contraceptive pill|the combined pill) 
- The pill is a small contraceptive pill you take orally on a daily basis to protect yourself from pregnancy. However, it is also used to help regulate periods and hormones! The pill commonly comes in two forms: the combined pill which contains oestrogen and progesterone, or the oestrogen-only pill.

+ what is (the progesterone pill|the progesterone only pill)
- The progesterone only pill is a form of birth control pill containing only progesterone, as oppose to the progesterone and oestrogen combined pill.\n 
^It is taken the orally once a day, just like the combined pill!

+ what is an iud
- The IUD (intrauterine contraceptive device) or coil, is a small, often T-shaped birth control device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. IUDs are one form of long-acting reversible birth control. You can also use a copper IUD for a none hormonal version of this contraception.

+ what is (an|the) implant
- The implant is another form of birth control and is a small implantable medical device often inserted into your arm to protect you from pregnancy. It works by slowly releasing a dose of progesterone into your body which prevents your ovaries from releasing an egg.

- There are many types of birth control available in the UK, however, not all contraceptive methods may work for your body and your needs. To find out which birth control method works best for you I recommend contacting a healthcare professional such as your GP or a sexual health clinic.\n 
^Some factors that may affect which birth control you choose are: the reason for taking the birth control, whether you want reversible or permanent protection, how often you want to take birth control, how regularly you want a period,  hormonal requirements or any family history of blood clots. Some of the options available are: 
^ - The combined pill 
^ - Condoms  
^ - Female condoms  
^ - Contraceptive implant  
^ - Contraceptive injection  
^ - Contraceptive patch  
^ - Caps or diaphragms  
^ - The IDU 
^ - The hormonal coil 
^ - Vaginal ring\n  
^For more information on each birth control option and for a more extensive list, please read the information provided by the NHS: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/">Read more here.</a>\n

+ [*] [the] morning after pill [*]
- Emergency contraception should only be taken within 3 days of having unprotected sex to lessen your chances of getting pregnant. However, remember the sooner you take it, the more likely it is to be effective.\n 
^There are 2 types of morning after pill available in the UK. Levonelle which you must take within 3 days of having unprotected sex, or the ellaOne which you must take within 5 days of having unprotected sex. Most women can use the emergency contraceptive pill. This includes women who can't use hormonal contraception, such as the combined pill, contraceptive patch and girls under 16 years old.\n  
^To access the morning after pill for free you should visit contraception clinics, Brook centres, some pharmacies, most sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics, most NHS walk-in centres and minor injuries units, most GP surgeries and some hospital accident and emergency (A&E) departments.\n  
^You can also purchase the morning after pill from shops such as Superdrug, boots and Lloyds pharmacy.\n
^For more information of emergency contraception, as well as where you can access it, please read <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/where-can-i-get-emergency-contraception/">please read more here.</a>\n


+ (how does|does) the morning after pill work
- The morning after pill is an emergency contraceptive pill that is taken after having unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. There are 2 different types of emergency contraceptive pills available in the UK.\n 
^Levonelle, which must be taken within 3 days of having unprotected sex\n 
^EllaOne, which must be taken within 5 days of having unprotected sex\n 
^It is important to note that although the morning after pill is considered to be around 85% - 95% affective, you can not 100% garantee that it will always prevent pregancy, which is why it is important to follow up any concerns by taking a pregancy test or talking to a health care professional! üòä

+ can i get pregnant when i am on birth control
- Although most women do not get pregnant while on birth control, there is a small possibility your contraception can fail as no birth control method is 100% effective. The only way to be 100% sure you will not get pregnant, is to not have any penetrative vaginal sex. One way to further protect yourself is to use more than one method of birth control, for example, the pill and a condom, although this still is not 100% effective.  

+ does birth control protect against (stis|stds|sti|std)
- Although birth control such as the pill, patch, ring, and IUD are very effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STIs and HIV. The only form of contraception that also protects against STIs is condoms, for example, the male external condoms or the female vaginal condom. However, The most reliable way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.

+ how do i get rid of a (std|sti)
- If you have been diagnosed with an STI you will need antibiotics to get rid of it, the easiest way to do this is to contact your GP or sexual health clinic!

Please remember, once you start antibiotic treatment, it is necessary to finish the prescription. 

+ how often should i get tested
- Regular testing for HIV and STIs is essential for good sexual health! Everyone should have an STI screen, including an HIV test, annually if having condomless sex. It is also advised to have an STI screening everytime you has sex with a new or casual partner.  

+ when can i have sex again after [having] a (std|sti)
- Although every STI is different it is advised you wait at least 7 days after finishing antibiotics for an STI to have sex again. However, I recommend discussing this with your health care professional for a more accurate time scale.
